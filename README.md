**ATTENTION**: It's a very early draft currently in active development!
Most probably it doesn't work. Don't try to contribute, unless you know
what you are doing.

It's an experimental virtual machine of [EO](https://www.eolang.org) programs, 
represented as [SODG](https://github.com/objectionary/sodg) graphs.

First, install
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm),
[Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/),
and [eolang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eolang) package.
Then, install `reo` package:

```bash
$ cargo install reo
```

Then, create a simple EO program in `app.eo` file:

```
[] > app
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    "Hello, world!\n"
```

Then, compile it to SODG using [eoc](https://github.com/objectionary/eoc):

```
$ eoc sodg
```

Finally, run it:

```
$ reo --eoc dataize app
```

You should see the "Hello, world!" being printed out.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```bash
$ cargo test -vv --release
```

If everything goes well, an executable binary will be in `target/release/reo`:

```bash
$ target/release/reo --help
```

Then, fork repository, make changes, send us a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run `cargo test` again.
